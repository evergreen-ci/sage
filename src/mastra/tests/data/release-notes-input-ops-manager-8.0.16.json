      "description": "We need to avoid recommending that customers use minor releases.\n\nHere's some context: The release notes for OM introduction of 8.2 support need tweaking a little, but are going to say something along the lines of:\n{quote} * Enables MongoDB Server 8.2 for production use for MongoDB deployments managed by Ops Manager 8.0 but is NOT supported for Ops Manager 8.0 backing databases, including AppDB.\n ** This minor release provides early access to *new features and improvements* ahead of the next Long Term Support (LTS) version.\n ** Minor releases like 8.2 are *not LTS* and follow a ~6-month release cadence. To receive ongoing bug and security fixes, you *must stay on the LTS version or upgrade to the latest available minor release*. Patches are not backported to previous minor versions (e.g., once 8.3 is released, 8.2 will no longer receive patches).\n ** Choosing the minor release path requires a commitment to performing *sequential upgrades* through each subsequent release. Skipping minor versions is not supported when upgrading.\n ** Upgrading to a new minor version requires updating the *Feature Compatibility Version (FCV)*, which is a critical step in the upgrade process, and adheres to the same upgrade logic as a [major version upgrade|https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ops-manager/current/tutorial/change-mongodb-version/].\n ** You have a *grace period of 2 months* after the next release is available to complete your upgrade and remain supported.{quote}\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have general docs to cover minor releases universally.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut what I think we ought to do is:\n # Ensure that only the latest major version patch (e.g. 8.0.x) shows up as the default selection for use.\n # If a minor version is selected, show a warning of:\n\n{quote}_*Caution:*_ *You are selecting a non-LTS (Minor) release.*\n\nMinor releases (e.g., 8.2) give you access to new server features sooner, but they have a rapid, ~6-month support cycle.\n\nPlease review the following support considerations before proceeding:\n # *No Backported Fixes* To receive ongoing bug and security patches, you *must* upgrade to the latest minor release. Once the next version (e.g., 8.3) is out, previous versions ( e.g., 8.2) *will no longer receive updates*.\n # *Sequential Upgrades Required* Once on this path, you *cannot skip* versions. To get from 8.2 to 9.0, you must upgrade sequentially through every subsequent minor release (e.g., 8.2 \u2192 8.3 \u2192 ... \u2192 9.0).\n # *FCV Upgrade Required* Each minor version upgrade requires an FCV (Feature Compatibility Version) change. This is a significant operation, [similar to a major version upgrade|https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ops-manager/current/tutorial/change-mongodb-version/], and impacts your ability to downgrade.\n # *Support Grace Period* You have a 2-month grace period to complete your upgrade after the next release becomes available.{quote}\n\nNot sure how we should convey this in the API??!\n\n\n",
